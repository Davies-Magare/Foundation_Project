<h1>Scribe</h1>
<p>Scribe is a writing study tool designed to help users learn how and where to
place specific words in their writing. Great writers don't create great literature
by accident; every element—words, punctuation marks, and paragraphs—is
deliberately placed for a reason. We often overlook these nuances when simply reading a
text.  Scribe allows users to paste a paragraph and shuffles each sentence
individually, rearranging the order of the words. The user's task is to reorder the words to
reconstruct the original text. This exercise helps the user to recognize and appreciate
how the author structured their work, making it an excellent way to improve
writing skills, punctuation, and grammar.</p>
